xnWeapons modified for the esx framework.
weapons, ammo, attachments and tints are purchasable via the ammunition store clicking on an item the script will check that the player has enough money
to purchase the item.

there are no permissions or job role this simply is the original script with a server script to check for the players balance and to remove the amount. 
If the player doesnâ€™t have enough money the item will not be given to the player. There is no database as the prices are in the client side script. 
I will look at creating a config file so the prices can be adjusted.

Blips have been added 

Removed Give all weapons and give all ammo!

** There is still an issue with MK2 weapons saveing this is an issue with the original script! **

thanks to Jaymo1101 for the original script
